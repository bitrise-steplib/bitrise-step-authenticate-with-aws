Planning:

Challenge for ourselves:
According to the docs, aws CLI picks up credentials from the predefined environment variables. If the step does not
support anything else, the step is a bit useless?

Inputs:
- aws-region: required? Could we use the "AWS_REGION environment variable as a default?
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- (optional) session token?
- (optional) roleToAssume?


Output:

Export env vars:

In the related github-action, "outputEnvCredentials" input defines if the credentials are exported as environment variables.

AWS_REGION
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID <= has to a sensitive output
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY <= has to a sensitive output

Should we write ~/.aws/credentials file?

Should we export $CACHE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and $CACHE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY?

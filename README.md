[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-authenticate-with-aws?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-authenticate-with-aws/releases)

The step authenticates with AWS using an OIDC token.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This step authenticates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) token.

It retrieves an identity token from Bitrise, assumes the specified AWS role using the token, and generates temporary AWS credentials.

The generated AWS credentials are then set as environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) for use in subsequent steps.
